# WebSocket-Prosemirror-Log

A basic collaborative rich-text editor using [list-positions](https://github.com/mweidner037/list-positions#readme) and [list-formatting](https://github.com/mweidner037/list-formatting#readme), a WebSocket server, and [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/). It supports arbitrary schemas and works similarly to ProseMirror's built-in collaboration system, at the expense of representing the state only as a log, instead of in a "list-positions-native" way.

When a client makes a change, a _mutation_ describing that change is sent to the server in JSON format. The server assigns that mutation a sequence number in the log and echoes it to all connected clients. It also stores the log to send to future clients.

A client's state is always given by:

- First, apply all mutations received from (or confirmed by) the server, in the same order as the server's log.
- Next, apply all pending local mutations, which have been performed by the local user but not yet confirmed by the server.

To process a remote message from the server, the pending local mutations are undone, the remote message is applied, and then the pending local mutations are redone. If a mutation no longer makes sense in its current state, it is skipped.

Internally, each mutation consists of ordinary ProseMirror [steps](https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#transform), but with their list indices (ProseMirror positions) replaced by Positions from list-positions. That way, it is always possible to "rebase" a step on top of the server's latest state: just look up the new indices corresponding to each steps' Positions. (Internally, the lookup uses an [Outline](https://github.com/mweidner037/list-positions#outline).)

Overall, this strategy is the same as [ProseMirror's built-in collaboration system](https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#collab), but using immutable Positions (CRDT-style) instead of indices that are transformed during rebasing (OT-style). As a result, clients never need to rebase and resubmit steps: steps can be rebased "as-is".

Using ProseMirror's built-in steps lets many ProseMirror features work out-of-the-box, just like with ProseMirror's built-in collaboration. In contrast, [y-prosemirror](https://github.com/yjs/y-prosemirror) and [websocket-prosemirror-blocks](../websocket-prosemirror-blocks#readme) rewrite the ProseMirror state directly, which breaks the default cursor tracking, undo/redo, and [some other features](https://discuss.yjs.dev/t/decorationsets-and-remapping-broken-with-y-sync-plugin/845).

Code organization:

- `src/common/`: Messages shared between clients and the server.
- `src/server/`: WebSocket server.
- `src/site/`: ProseMirror client.

## Installation

First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Then run `npm i`.

## Commands

### `npm run dev`

Build the app from `src/`, in [development mode](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/). You can also use `npm run watch`.

### `npm run build`

Build the app from `src/`, in [production mode](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/).

### `npm start`

Run the server on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Use multiple browser windows at once to test collaboration.

To change the port, set the `$PORT` environment variable.

### `npm run clean`

Delete `dist/`.
